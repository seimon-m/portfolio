                The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations are a
                call to action for all countries and put the fight against
                poverty and inequality as well as for sustainable development
                and environmental protection on the same agenda. For this
                project, I chose goal number 10 with the main Goal of
                <strong>reducing inequality within and among countries</strong>
                and created a visualization for it. I experimented with different
                techniques until I found a way to represent the inequalities mentioned
                in Goal 10. One of the United Nations' "17 Sustainable Development
                Goals" is to reduce inequality, numbered as Goal 10.

                    This chart compares four countries on each continent. The
                    right-hand circle of each continent shows the growth rates
                    of the bottom 40 percent of the population and the left-hand
                    circle shows the growth of the total population. Income
                    growth is estimated using individual income data or
                    individual consumption data over a period of about five
                    years between 2009 and 2017.
