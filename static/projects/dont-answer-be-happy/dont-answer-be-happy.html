            <p>
                The installation <italic>Don't Answer Be Happy</italic> creates
                an interactive experience in which everything revolves around
                the personal smartphone. Engrossed in a conversation between
                their own personal smartphone and the surrounding artificial
                intelligence, visitors are compelled to take a stand.
                Confrontations with the ambivalence of digital reality arise,
                and evasion is not possible. The experienced space reflects upon
                the digital colonization regarding people and regions of this
                world outside of global tech hotspots.

                <p>
                    Together with Jonas Wolter I developed the whole concept of
                    this interactive installation. In fact, we developed
                    everything together in close exchange. We iterated on the
                    concept and content and created a proper design system. For
                    the programming I focused more on the web application, the
                    server and the real-time communication between these.

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>
                    Conceptually the installation addresses the discourse of
                    globalized technology and peeks behind the curtain of the
                    hype surrounding artificial intelligence. In essence, it’s
                    about how technological developments have an impact on our
                    society and what this means for different regions and
                    peoples of this world. Many tech solutions that have become
                    indispensable in the global North and which we have become
                    accustomed to, can only exist through the systematic
                    exploitation of the global South. Without the major
                    discrepancy in income and living conditions, we would not be
                    able to live out this (in our case) tech luxury to this
                    extent. The installation
                    <italic>Don't Answer Be Happy</italic> focuses on the people
                    who make Western tech luxury possible in the first place
                    through their daily work in precarious conditions, be it
                    clickwork in the creation of datasets that serve as the
                    basis for AI algorithms, in content moderation, in the
                    production of electronic devices or in their recycling. In
                    the Congo, people are exploited to extract gold and cobalt
                    for our smartphones. In China, workers have to assemble
                    electronic devices which they could never afford due to non
                    livable wages. In order for us to use social media without
                    images of violence and abuse, people have to categorize
                    images of violence, racism, and sexual assault every day. AI
                    systems are only highly “intelligent” because they have been
                    trained by thousands of clickworkers in India. However for
                    us living in the global North, this side of digital reality
                    is not largely visible.

                <h4>Narration</h4>
                <p>
                    In the installation
                    <italic>Don't Answer Be Happy</italic> we have developed a
                    narrative around the personal smartphone, which deals with
                    the issues described previously. The smartphone is the focal
                    point and the depicting element that perfectly represents
                    the difficulties created by technological globalization and
                    digital colonization. In the installation the role of the
                    visitor is inverted. The visitor is degraded to a
                    clickworker and only acts as an extended arm of the
                    smartphone. The smartphone develops an intelligence, but
                    does not understand the irrationality and contradictory
                    nature of human interaction with technology and begins to
                    ask naive questions to its user. The visitor is confronted
                    with questions and is required to take a stance.

                <h4>Interaction</h4>
                <p>
                    The smartphone as the focal point of the different conflicts
                    is also the interactive element. A new type of interaction
                    was specifically developed for this installation, based on
                    gyroscope data of the smartphone, which is accessed via a
                    web application. All visual and auditory experiences in the
                    space are based on the rotation of the smartphone. The
                    visitor also provides answers to the questions by pointing
                    the smartphone at different projections, resulting in an
                    immersive experience.
