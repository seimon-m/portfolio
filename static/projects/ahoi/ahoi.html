                Since my earliest childhood, I have been a member of the Scouts,
                and I associate an incredible amount of my experiences with it.
                I am still involved in the Scouts, but now more in the
                background. For many years we have had a community magazine,
                namely <italic>ahoi</italic>. This has not been changed for
                years and was printed in black and white. I have done a complete
                redesign and changed the process to printing in color. For this
                I developed a design system that should appeal to children,
                teenagers and adults. The <italic>ahoi</italic> is published
                twice a year and is published and edited by myself.
